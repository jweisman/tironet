# Tironet — Claude Context

This file captures architectural decisions, constraints, and gotchas for Claude when working on this codebase.

## Tech Stack Summary

- **Next.js 16** App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4
- **NextAuth v5** JWT strategy, Google OAuth + email magic link + WhatsApp OTP (Twilio Verify)
- **PostgreSQL** via Prisma ORM
- **PowerSync** (`@powersync/web` + `@powersync/react`) for offline-first sync — Sync Streams edition 3
- **PWA** via `@ducanh2912/next-pwa`

## PowerSync Architecture

### Why Sync Streams (not Sync Rules)

We use **PowerSync Sync Streams** (`edition: 3`, recommended for all new apps as of 2026) rather than the legacy Sync Rules YAML format. Sync Streams supports `JOIN`, subqueries, and CTEs — avoiding the need to denormalize foreign keys into every table just for sync scoping.

Config lives in [`src/lib/powersync/sync-config.yaml`](src/lib/powersync/sync-config.yaml), mounted into the PowerSync Docker container. The main config is [`powersync.config.yaml`](powersync.config.yaml).

### JWT claims for sync scoping

The `/api/powersync/token` endpoint signs a JWT with three custom claims resolved from the user's `UserCycleAssignment` rows:

| Claim | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `cycle_ids` | `string[]` | All cycles the user is assigned to |
| `platoon_ids` | `string[]` | All platoons the user can see (pre-expanded: company commanders get all platoons in their company) |
| `squad_id` | `string \| null` | The squad for squad commanders; null otherwise |

Sync streams use `auth.parameter('cycle_ids')` etc. to filter rows server-side. No client-side subscription parameters are needed — all streams use `auto_subscribe: true`.

### Local Docker setup quirks

- **`sslmode: disable`** must be set as a top-level field in `powersync.config.yaml` under the connection — NOT as a `?sslmode=disable` URL parameter. The pgwire library used by PowerSync ignores URL-embedded SSL params.
- **MongoDB must run as a replica set** (`--replSet rs0`). Standalone MongoDB is not supported by PowerSync. After first launch, `rs.initiate()` must be run once manually (see README).
- **PostgreSQL publication** must be created once: `CREATE PUBLICATION powersync FOR ALL TABLES`. Required for WAL logical replication.
- **Docker Compose reads `.env`**, not `.env.local`. Next.js reads `.env.local`. Keep both files in sync for shared variables.
- **`docker compose restart`** does not re-read `.env`. Use `docker compose up -d` to pick up env changes.

## Data Model Constraints

### Squads cannot be reassigned between platoons

The `Soldier` → `Squad` → `Platoon` hierarchy is treated as immutable within a cycle. The API enforces this:
- `PATCH /api/admin/structure/[id]` only accepts `name` — no `platoonId` change
- `PATCH /api/soldiers/[id]` only accepts profile fields — no `squadId` change

This matters because PowerSync scopes `activity_reports` to users via a JOIN on `activities.platoon_id`. If a squad moved platoons mid-cycle, existing reports would fall out of sync scope. Do not add squad reassignment without also rethinking the sync strategy.

### Soldiers cannot be transferred between squads

Similarly, `Soldier.squadId` is write-once. The "transferred" status (`SoldierStatus.transferred`) marks a soldier as inactive rather than moving them.

## API Conventions

- All protected routes call `auth()` from `@/lib/auth/auth` and check `session.user`
- Admin routes use `requireAdmin()` from `@/lib/api/admin-guard`
- Non-admin data access is scoped via `getActivityScope()` which resolves the user's role and unit IDs for a given cycle
- Polymorphic FK: `UserCycleAssignment.unitId` points to `companies`, `platoons`, or `squads` depending on `unitType`. Referential integrity is enforced at the application layer, not by the DB.

## Environment Variable Naming

- Variables used inside the PowerSync Docker container must be prefixed `PS_` to work with the `!env` tag in `powersync.config.yaml`
- `POWERSYNC_JWT_SECRET` is the raw secret (used by Next.js to sign tokens)
- `POWERSYNC_JWT_SECRET_B64URL` is its base64url encoding (used by PowerSync to verify tokens via JWKS)
